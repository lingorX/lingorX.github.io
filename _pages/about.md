I am currently a Ph.D. student at [ReLER Lab](https://reler.net), [AAII](https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/our-research/australian-artificial-intelligence-institute), University of Technology Sydney, under the supervision of Prof. Wenguan Wang and Prof. Yi Yang. My long-term research endeavor is dedicated to building a machine that can foster human-like reasoning capabilities through the integration of neural computing and knowledge-induced symbolic reasoning, so as to effectively tackle complex real-world tasks.

## My research interests includes
- Knowledge-Driven AI: Neuro-Symbolic AI, Neural Logic 
- Computer Vision Technology: Object Localization, Image Segmentation, Video Analytics.
- Deep Learning: Graph Neural Networks, Unsupervised/Semi-Supervised Learning.
